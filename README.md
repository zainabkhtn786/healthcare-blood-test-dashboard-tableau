This is an interactive **healthcare analytics dashboard** built using Tableau to analyze and visualize patient blood test data. The dashboard helps medical professionals and data analysts quickly gain insights into patient demographics and key health indicators such as Hemoglobin, Glucose, WBC, Platelets, and Cholesterol levels.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to deliver a **comprehensive view of patient health metrics** in a visual and actionable format. It allows users to monitor patterns, detect abnormalities, and explore demographic distributions — all in a clean, professional layout.
